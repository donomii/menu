# menu

An cross-platform experimental system for displaying user menus, that turned into a popup launcher and more.

# Use

Run ```universal_menu_hotkey_monitor.exe``` or ```universal_menu_hotkey_monitor```.  You can then press the hotkey to make the launcher pop up or go away.

On windows, the hotkey is CAPS LOCK

On Mac, the hotkey is F12

For command line scripting, there is a command line program that does the same as the hotkey: ```universal_menu_command_line_toggle.exe```.  This works with AppleScript and other launchers.  I use it with the program "My TouchBar, My Rules" to add a touchbar button that will open and close the launcher.


##  Build
